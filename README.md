## 🧭 Overview
This project demonstrates how GA4 data can be transformed into a professional, interactive dashboard for performance tracking and data storytelling.  
The dashboard provides insights into **traffic channels, user devices, session activity**, and **engagement behavior** across U.S. regions.

### Key Visual Components:
- 🗺 **Regional Traffic by City** — City-level heatmap for session density visualization  
- 📈 **Daily Sessions & Active Users** — Trend analysis of daily user engagement  
- 📊 **Sessions by Channel** — Acquisition breakdown (Direct, Organic, Paid, Referral)  
- 📱 **Device Distribution** — Share of sessions from desktop, mobile, tablet, and smart TV  
- 💬 **Engagement Rate by Channel** — Performance indicator for traffic quality

## 🧠 Insights Summary
1. **Mobile users dominate**, accounting for 73.5% of total sessions → optimize for mobile-first design.  
2. **Direct traffic** leads with ~8.3K sessions, followed by **Organic Search** (~6.9K).  
3. **Engagement rates** are exceptionally high across all channels — with **Organic Video** and **Email** reaching nearly 100%.  
4. A minor decline in user activity near late October indicates a seasonal behavior pattern.  
5. **Referral** and **Social** traffic show moderate volume but excellent engagement quality.
